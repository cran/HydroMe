\title{
A four-parameter van Genuchten water retention model
}
\description{
This is a four-parameter function to determine water retention hydraulic parameters contained in the van Genuchten water retention model
}
\usage{
SSvgm4(input, Thr, Ths, alp, nscal)
}
\arguments{
  \item{input}{
Suction potential/head as contained in the x-column of the xy water retention table or data
}
  \item{Thr}{
This is the residual moisture content. It's the moisture content when suction potential is very high (almost at the drying point)
}
  \item{Ths}{
This is the saturated moisture content. It's the moisture content when suction potential is very low (almost at the saturation point)
}
  \item{alp}{
It's natural logarithm of the inverse of air-entry potential or bubbling pressure
}
  \item{nscal}{
This is a parameter or index for the pore-size distribution
}
}
\details{
Van Genuchten model is a type of self-starting nonlinear curve fitting model for fitting water retention characteristics using experimental data. In this model, the restriction of m=1-1/n has been imposed on the water retention characteristics. Air-entry potential = exp(alp). If warnings are given during the estimation process, try to increase the iteration limit using control function. Sometimes the warnings can be suppressed using (warn=-1)/ignored since they do not terminate the process
