Description: This version 2 of the HydroMe v.1 package estimates the parameters
  in infiltration and water retention models by curve-fitting methods <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2008.08.011>. The
  models considered are those commonly used in soil science.  It has new models
  for water retention and characteristic curves.
