Title: Estimating Water Retention and Infiltration Model Parameters
        using Experimental Data
Version: 2.1.1
Description: Contains functions for estimating the parameters of infiltration and water retention models using the curve-fitting methods as discussed in Omuto and Gumbe (2009) ("Estimating water infiltration and retention characteristics using a computer program in R"<doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2008.08.011>). The models considered are those that are commonly used in soil science. Version 2 of the package has new models for water retention characteristic curves.
